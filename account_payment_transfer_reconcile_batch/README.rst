Batch reconciliation for transfer lines created in payment orders
=================================================================

This module allows to process with the connector technology the heavy task of
reconciliation of the receivable/payable journal entries of a payment order
against the created entries in transfer accounts.

This approach provides many advantages, similar to the ones we get
using that connector for e-commerce:

- Asynchronous: the operation is done in background, and users can
  continue to work.
- Dedicated workers: the queued jobs are performed by specific workers
  (processes). This is good for a long task, since the main workers are
  busy handling HTTP requests and can be killed if operations take
  too long, for example.
- Multiple transactions: this is an operation that doesn't need to be
  atomic, and if a line out of 100,000 fails, it is possible to catch
  it, see the error message, and fix the situation. Meanwhile, all
  other jobs can proceed.

Inspired on *account_move_batch_validate* module from Camptocamp and ACSONE.

Installation
------------

















This module requires the *connector* module, hosted on
`OCA/connector <https://github.com/OCA/connector>`_

Configuration
-------------

















This will only work for payment modes that have a transfer account set.

Usage
-----




















=====

When exporting the payment order, click on *Validate* to generate the transfer
move. One connector job will be created for each payment line for a deferred
conciliation of this line.
